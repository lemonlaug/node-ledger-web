### Installing Ledger

The simplest way to install Ledger 3 is through [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

    brew install ledger --HEAD

The `--HEAD` option is required to install version 3.x.

## Usage

Clone the `node-ledger-web` git repository from GitHub.

    git clone https://github.com/slashdotdash/node-ledger-web.git

Install the dependencies with npm.

    cd node-ledger-web
    npm install

Bower is used to manage JavaScript and CSS dependencies. Install it and our dependencies

    npm install -g bower
    bower install

Grunt is used for building the front-end assets. Install grunt and run its default build task.

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt

Finally, run the express application and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser.

    node app.js
